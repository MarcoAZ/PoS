# Point of Sale System
This is a pretty simple point of sale system I was asked to create as part of a job interview. 
The user is capable of CRUD actions for menu items, taxes, and promotional discounts. 
It features a user creation and login screen. Orders are created by selecting items and any applicable discounts. The bill dynamically updates
the list of items and the total including taxes and discounts whenever an item is added. On order completion, the order is added to a sales
history table with information such as time of sale, cashier name, total, and total taxes/discounts.

## Built With
